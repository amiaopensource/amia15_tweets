DeusExCinema: The lineup of George Eastman Museum's Nitrate Picture Show earlier this year. Prints came in from all over. #amia15 https://t.co/v5VqsaLaRr
DeusExCinema: I've worked on nitrate collections at @OrHist and @MuseumModernArt, neither of which can actually screen those reels. Sad stuff. #amia15
DeusExCinema: Built in 1949, it still uses the same projectors today, and has always been equipped to screen their vast nitrate collection. #amia15
DeusExCinema: George Eastman Museum's Dryden Theatre, in Rochester, NY, is one of only a handful of cinemas in the U.S. that can screen nitrate. #amia15
theroselibrary: Sharing is caring. Definitely could use more case scenarios for copyright.  #amia15 #copyright

peaceshrine: Nitrate handlers maybe ought to ventilate. #amia15 #nitratecommittee
theroselibrary: There is no definitive guide to rights. It should always be an ongoing discussion. Isn't that the nature of the archival profession? #amia15
peaceshrine: Nitrate dust won't ignite from impact or friction (most likely). #amia15 #nitratecommittee
DeusExCinema: Meanwhile at the Nitrate Committee, tests on nitrate powder for shock and friction sensitivity proved negative for ignition. #amia15

laurensx: fortunoff archive doesnt impose a chronology with its interviews. survivors try to transform memory to words sometimes for 1st time #amia15
