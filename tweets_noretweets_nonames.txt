@DinahHandel @dericed Seems like a wider education challenge though, not just for #avarchiving? #amia15
#takingstock Do any of the programmes have numbers / research on amount of expansion &amp; employability that exists in &amp; for the field? #amia15
sustainable future for av archivists involves moving to holland, sometimes borrowing dvds from the library, returning them promptly #amia15
#amia15 @SkillsetSSC finds employers most concerned with soft or "attitudinal skills" more than practical techniques that can be trained
@DinahHandel makes me sad to think how inaccessible field is for so many people &amp; how it financially debilitates those who pursue. #amia15

Newcomer mixer and mentor breakfast not at #amia15 to make room for DAS. Budget not shared to save printing cost.

#amia15 call for mentor-mentee for first-timer program to be continued forward so next 25 years can learn from last 25. Maybe even online
A call to reinstate a tangible mentor/mentee program is üòé #amia15

#amia15 "many individuals from the library of congress are not here because they are not funded."  yup
The #amia15 leadership has been thinking &amp; discussing about thinking &amp; discussing the thinking &amp; discussing so that they can think &amp; discuss
A great addition to the #amia15 affordability statement by @CaseyEDavis1, who points out that we're pricing students out of AMIA

Emulation as variability in accordance with the variability during original creation ;) Party Like Its 1999 #amia15
Interesting q's abt authenticity re: emulation in this #amia15 session. To me, like asking if pacemakers threaten authenticity of human life
Apparently #kimjongil was a big fan of Ealing comedies! #TheMoreYouKnow #amia15
#amia15 @smallandmath Rejecting the myth of single authentic digital environment in the case of original digital works
A 25,000 film collection is nothing to sneeze at. The human rights issues, however... 
#KimJongIlAndChill #amia15
#amia15 at emulation panel, what is it about emulation that makes artist reject it as an option?
Is emulation an acceptable alternative?  Not an easy answer #amia15
McKinney: Important because = complete film history of NK Cinema from 1948 - present #amia15
Main issue w/#kimjongil archive is #accessanduse! NK archive demanded quality preservation but what good if no one can use? #amia15
Love it! Presenter and her new baby presenting together remotely at #amia15! #rava15
McKinney: Tried to reach out to NK film archivists but got no response. #amia15
Grateful for #amia15 program app. This year when I lost my program I was able to call it. https://t.co/olStwWMboY

McKinney: Kim Jong-Un doesn't share father's obsession w/ film. What is the future of the archive? Acquisition of films slowed down #amia15
U of Utah takeaway- be flexible planning digitizations projects, you might not get what you asked for but every step is progress #amia15

Emulation involves questions of authenticity and artist intent. #amia15 #emulation

McKinney: How was film collection acquired? Borrowed prints from int'l. archives as if for embassy screening, then copied onto 35 mm #amia15
There are 14 video games available in Timothy Leary collection at NYPL using DOSBox #amia15 #emulation
In case you were wondering Sean Connery was apparently Kim Jong-Il's favorite Bond. #amia15 #007

The effort to screen a film on 35 should not be undermined by missing reels. It's the thought that counts after all. #amia15
Holders of incomplete 35mm prints should not be concerned with dropping into digital to fill in for missing reels. #amia15

I've worked on nitrate collections at @OrHist and @MuseumModernArt, neither of which can actually screen those reels. Sad stuff. #amia15
Built in 1949, it still uses the same projectors today, and has always been equipped to screen their vast nitrate collection. #amia15
George Eastman Museum's Dryden Theatre, in Rochester, NY, is one of only a handful of cinemas in the U.S. that can screen nitrate. #amia15
Sharing is caring. Definitely could use more case scenarios for copyright.  #amia15 #copyright

There is no definitive guide to rights. It should always be an ongoing discussion. Isn't that the nature of the archival profession? #amia15
